# Task1
The player management system will be for a games development company. Its purpose will be for organising game competitions that take place within the medium of the computer games developed by them. It will ultimately serve the users of these games, therefore requiring their game account information in order to function in a way that reflects and complements their gameplay. From the game development company’s point of view, it will also require features to allow them themselves to administrate the system.

# API Application
## Scenario
The context to the project is the ability for consumers to be able to intuitively and efficiently manage a database from their Android device through the use of a client application. The database in question is for the purpose of education, as it stores information about students, the programmes they are enrolled in, and principally, how both of these sets of information relate to the projects they are undertaking and the attributes of the projects in of themselves.

## Purpose
The application, by using the API to connect to the database, provides information on students, the programmes they are enrolled in, and principally and mostly the projects that they are undertaking in respect to these programmes. This is displayed on the application’s various interfaces where appropriate.
